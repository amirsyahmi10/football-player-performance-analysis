## 📝 Project Summary
This project analyzes football player performance data from 2014–2020.  
Using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers insights on scoring patterns, assists, discipline, playing time, and performance efficiency.  
Engineered features such as **Goal Efficiency** and **xG Difference** help highlight key players and trends across different positions.
